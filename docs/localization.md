# Localization

Localization of the editor is currently very easy, the process is very similar to button customization.
You just need to modify [Editor buttons](https://github.com/Raiper34/ngx-simple-text-editor/blob/main/projects/ngx-simple-text-editor/src/lib/constants/editor-buttons.ts) in your code base, rewrite the `label`s, and `title`s, and use it in `EditorConfig` editor configuration.
See the example below.
